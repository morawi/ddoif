# This is a protocol of fashion items containing 
# names, vocabulary and terminology of clothing and accessories 
# Each item has the following structure:
#       item:
#         type: 
#         all-types:
#             -x,
#             -y,
#             ...
#             -z
#         comment: >
# where 'type' is one name selected from all-types {x, y, ..., z}
# 'all-types' contains all the possible item classes
# 'comment' may contain some comments about the names, classes, for example, ambiguity.
#
# Some times the item has sub-items. Future realeases should have more sub-items.
# For now, we'll keep it simple,in general.
#
#
#      GENERAL COMMENTS
# KEYS: 
# 1. The hyphen is needed to be able to convert the yaml to xml, and then, backward xml to yaml
# 2. All keys are in lower case letters
# 3. Initials of entry names are capitalized
# 4. Double quotation marks "" are used to mare text if needed, example, "O'Reilly"
