    # This care guide if included will be very useful for customers, 
    # I always tell my wife (jokingly) to keep cut the labels and arrange
    # them in an Album near the washin machine for her to follow the guides
    # prior to washing them lol ... as can bee seen, the information is huge
    # and one cannot deal with the situation without the help of thcnology,
    # using a chip/cared/bar-code readable by the washing-machine so that the washing-macnhine
    # itself decides which care programme to use during the whole process
    # we may also think of an intelligent iron that adjust its setting according to 
    # the fabric and material of the garment.
